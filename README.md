### Hi, i'm Zaeen 👋
I'm currently based in West Africa (The Gambia). I work as a technical assistant and economist as part of the [ODI Fellowship](https://odi.org/en/fellowship-scheme/). Prior to this, I worked in a international development consultancy firm (with the Global Health & Education portfolio), where I focused on impact evaluation and M&E. I also worked at the [Centre for Sustainable Employment](https://azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/cse). I love economics---specifically, applied econometrics, labour and the microeconomics of development and I am passionate about using data and causal inference to better understand our world. I enjoy making, using and learning from the different digital public goods that people make and share. I also enjoy data visualisation 🎨, graphs 📈 and pretty presentations 👩‍🏫. You can view my academic research [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kParvqgAAAAJ&hl=en). A new working paper is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XG1dQUbuA_t10AhTuruqfNNvXQ3VjBkE/view)!

#### I'm passionate about  
✔️ Arsenal FC 🔴  
✔️ Research methods & research design 📄  
✔️ Teaching R & Stata 💻  
✔️ Labour economics & applied econometrics 🤓    
✔️ Supporting my local gin & tonic industry 🍸  
 
#### Some public goods that I have created/co-created
Here are some of my personal contributions to the world of digital public goods - they are all built either in ```R``` or ```Stata```. All the ```RShiny``` apps are freely accessible, while Stata packages can be installed via ssc.

#### RShiny
1. [ODK2Doc](https://zaeendesouza.shinyapps.io/ODK2Doc/)
2. [CascadeR](https://zaeendesouza.shinyapps.io/CascadeR/)
3. [MergeR](https://zaeendesouza.shinyapps.io/MergeR/)

#### Academic Stuff
For those interested in applied econometrics using R - I have a series of applied problem sets from the Stock & Watson Textbook available [here](https://github.com/zaeendesouza/econometric-methods) and slides on data visualisation using ```ggplot``` [here](https://github.com/zaeendesouza/ggplotworkshop)
