### Hi, i'm Zaeen 👋

I'm currently based in West Africa (The Gambia). I work as a technical assistant and economist as part of the [ODI Fellowship](https://odi.org/en/fellowship-scheme/). Prior to this, I worked in a international development consultancy firm (with the Global Health & Education portfolio), where I focused on impact evaluation and M&E. I also worked at the [Centre for Sustainable Employment](https://azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/cse). I love economics---specifically, applied econometrics, labour and the microeconomics of development and I am passionate about using data and causal inference to better understand our world. I enjoy making, using and learning from the different digital public goods that people make and share. I also enjoy data visualisation 🎨, graphs 📈 and pretty presentations 👩‍🏫. You can view my academic research [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kParvqgAAAAJ&hl=en).

**I'm passionate about:**  
✔️ Arsenal FC 🔴  
✔️ Research methods & research design 📄  
✔️ Teaching R & Stata 💻  
✔️ Labour economics & applied econometrics 🤓    
✔️ Supporting my local gin & tonic industry 🍸  
 
**Some public goods that I have created/co-created** <br>

**Academic Stuff**
For those interested in applied econometrics using R - I have a series of applied problem sets from the Stock & Watson Textbook available [here](https://github.com/zaeendesouza/econometric-methods) and slides on data visualisation using ```ggplot``` [here](https://github.com/zaeendesouza/ggplotworkshop)
