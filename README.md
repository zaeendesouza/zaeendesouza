### Hi, i'm Zaeen 👋

I'm currently based in Bangalore, India. I love economics, and my goal is to become an economist one day 📈. I enjoy making, using and learning from the different digital public goods that people make  (my own small contribution is [here](https://zaeendesouza.shinyapps.io/ODK2Doc/)). I love data vizualisation, graphs and nice looking presentations (I also have *strong* opinions on all of those!).


**I'm passionate about:**  
✔️ Arsenal FC 🔴  
✔️ Research methods 📄  
✔️ Teaching R programming 💻  
✔️ Social justice ✊  
✔️ R, Stata & LaTeX 👨‍💻  
✔️ Development and labour economics via applied econometrics 🤓    
✔️ Supporting my local gin & tonic industry 🍸  

**I deeply dislike:**  
❌ Bigotry in any shape or form   
❌ Tottenham  
❌ Paywalls
