### Hi, i'm Zaeen 👋

I'm an international development consultant who is currently based in Bangalore, India. I love economics, and my goal is to become an economist one day 📈. I enjoy making, using and learning from the different digital public goods that people make  (my own small contribution is [here](https://zaeendesouza.shinyapps.io/ODK2Doc/)). I love data vizualisation, graphs and nice looking presentations (I have **strong** and well documented opinions on all of those - however please take them lightly).


I'm passionate about (in no order):
  - ✔️ Arsenal Football Club
  - ✔️ Survey data
  - ✔️ Social justice
  - ✔️ Coding in R, Stata & Latex 👨‍💻 
  - ✔️ Development and labour economics via applied econometrics 🤓
  - ✔️ Accessibility and inclusion 
  
 A social cause I take very seriously:
  - 🍸 Supporting my local gin & tonic industry

I dislike (in no order):
- ❌ Bigotry, in any of its many unpleasment forms
- ❌ Online trolls
- ❌ Python zealots
