### Hi, i'm Zaeen 👋

I'm currently based in Bangalore, India. I work as a consultant in international development (health & education), where I focus on impact evaluation and M&E. I love economics, and my goal is to become an economist *one day*. I enjoy making, using and learning from the different digital public goods that people make (my own small contribution is [here](https://zaeendesouza.shinyapps.io/ODK2Doc/)). I also enjoy data visualisation 🎨, graphs 📈 and pretty presentations 👩‍🏫.


**I'm passionate about:**  
✔️ Arsenal FC 🔴  
✔️ Research methods & research design 📄  
✔️ Teaching R & Stata 💻  
✔️ Labour economics & applied econometrics 🤓    
✔️ Supporting my local gin & tonic industry 🍸
