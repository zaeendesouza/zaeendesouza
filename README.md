### Hi, i'm Zaeen üëã
I'm currently based in West Africa (The Gambia). I work as a technical assistant, economist and [ODI Fellow](https://odi.org/en/fellowship-scheme/). Prior to this, I worked in a international development consultancy firm (with the Global Health & Education portfolio), where I focused on impact evaluation and M&E. I also worked at the [Centre for Sustainable Employment](https://azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/cse). I love economics - specifically, applied econometrics, labour and the microeconomics of development and I am passionate about using data and causal inference to better understand our world. I enjoy making, using and learning from the different digital public goods that people make and share. I also enjoy data visualisation üé®, graphs üìà and neat presentations üë©‚Äçüè´. You can view my academic research [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kParvqgAAAAJ&hl=en). **I have a new working paper, co-authored with [Anand Srivastava](https://sites.google.com/site/anandshrivastava1984/) and [Girish Bahal](https://www.girishbahal.com/), that can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XG1dQUbuA_t10AhTuruqfNNvXQ3VjBkE/view)!**

#### Some public goods that I have created/co-created
Here are some of my personal contributions to the world of digital public goods - they are all built either in ```R``` or ```Stata```. All the ```RShiny``` apps are freely accessible, while Stata packages can be installed via ssc.

### RShiny  
1. **[ODK2Doc](https://zaeendesouza.shinyapps.io/ODK2Doc/)**: A simple and easy to use tool that automatically converts ODK/Kobo/SurveyCTO `xls` survey files into formatted and editable Word documents.
2. **[CascadeR](https://zaeendesouza.shinyapps.io/CascadeR/)**: A tool that uses micro data to build cascading lists that can be pasted directly into a ODK/Kobo/SurveyCTO `xls` survey files.
3. **[MergeR](https://zaeendesouza.shinyapps.io/MergeR/)**: A WYSIWYG no-coding tool for merging `xls` & `csv` datasets (`1:1`, `1:m`).

### Stata  
1. **[ALLCATPLOT](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=kParvqgAAAAJ&citation_for_view=kParvqgAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C)**: `allcatplot` ensures that all predefined response categories for a variable, including those that are not present in the dataset, are included in a graph.
2. **[RATIO_PLOT](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=kParvqgAAAAJ&citation_for_view=kParvqgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC)**: `ratio_plot` is designed to plot ratios and confidence intervals of specified variables with an option for disaggregation.
3. **[MEAN_CI_PLOT](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=kParvqgAAAAJ&citation_for_view=kParvqgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C)**: `mean_ci_plot` offers a user-friendly command for visualizing means and confidence intervals of specified variables, with an option for disaggregation.
4. **[PLOT_CONFIDENTLY](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=kParvqgAAAAJ&citation_for_view=kParvqgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC)**: `plot_confidently` allows users to visualize the mean and confidence interval of a specified variable, with options for up to two levels of disaggregation.

#### Academic Stuff
For those interested in applied econometrics using R - I have a series of applied problem sets from the Stock & Watson Textbook available [here](https://github.com/zaeendesouza/econometric-methods) and slides on data visualisation using ```ggplot``` [here](https://github.com/zaeendesouza/ggplotworkshop).
