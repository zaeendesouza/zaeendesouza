### Hi, i'm Zaeen 👋

I'm an international development consultant who is currently based in Bangalore, India. I love economics, and my goal is to become an economist one day 📈. I enjoy making, using and learning from the different digital public goods that people make  (my own small contribution is [here](https://zaeendesouza.shinyapps.io/ODK2Doc/)). I love data vizualisation, graphs and nice looking presentations (I have **strong** and well documented opinions on all of those - however please take them lightly).


**I'm passionate about:**  
✔️ Arsenal Football Club 🔴  
✔️ Survey data 📄  
✔️ Social justice ✊  
✔️ Coding in R, Stata & Latex 👨‍💻  
✔️ Development and labour economics via applied econometrics 🤓    
✔️ Supporting my local gin & tonic industry 🍸  

**I dislike:**  
❌ Bigotry, in any of its many unpleasment forms  
❌ Online trolls  
❌ Python zealots
